# Abiotic Factor Valuables

**A mod that adds 5 shop items and 35 random valuables from the game Abiotic Factor!** <br>

Due to the similar pixelated art styles between Abiotic Factor and R.E.P.O., these items and valuables should fit right in aesthetically! <br>

All shop items are configurable. Valuables should be configured via *Enemy and Valuable Spawn Manager* or other similar mods. <br>

*These items have intentionally been kept spoiler-free. Please check out Abiotic Factor on Steam if you like these items!*

I've spent way more time modding games than I ever thought I would. If you'd like to donate to help me make more content like this, I have a Ko-Fi here: [Ko-Fi link <3](http://ko-fi.com/nikkidarkmatter)

## Items

**Crowbar:** A splice between a Sword and a Baseball Bat in terms of stats, it's a decently powerful melee weapon that costs similar amounts to the Baseball Bat. <br>

**Energy Pistol:** Only deals 40 damage, but is pretty accurate and ragdolls most lighter enemies. Has a good amount of battery life too. Quick reload time. Good for dealing with smaller threats, but capable of dealing with larger threats if you're willing to use up your battery. <br>

**Lodestone Crossbow:** Deals 200 damage, is highly accurate, and is capable of downing any enemy in the game for a decent amount of time. Long reload time. Only has 2 shots before recharging. Good to save for big threats. Rather expensive. <br>

***[NEW]*** **Slushie Bomb:** Throwable weapon that freezes enemies and players hit for 5 seconds, similar to stunning them. Once primed, shatters upon impact with any surface at a decent velocity. Can only spawn in the secret compartment in the shop. <br>

**Tech Scepter:** A powerful but expensive melee weapon that electrocutes foes. Not super durable due to its more technological build, and deals decent damage to other players or yourself if you accidentally (or intentionally) hit them. <br>
